/**
 * The application calls this API to request the selected platform's attestation key owner to generate or obtain

 * key id will do what is required to get this platform's attestation including getting any certification data
 * required from the PCE.  Depending on the type of attestation key and the attestation key owner, this API will
 * return the same attestation key public ID or generate a new one.  The caller can request that the attestation
 * key owner "refresh" the key.  This will cause the owner to either re-get the key or generate a new one.  The
 * platform's attestation key owner is expected to store the key in persistent memory and use it in the
 * subsequent quote generation APIs described below.
 *
 * In an environment where attestation key provisioning and certification needs to take place during a platform
 * deployment phase, an application can generate the attestation key, certify it with the PCK Cert and register
 * it with the attestation owners cloud infrastructure.  That way, the key is available during the run time
 * phase to generate code without requiring re-certification.
 *
 * The QE's target info is also returned by this API that will allow the application's enclave to generate a
 * REPORT that the attestation key owner's QE will verify using local REPORT-based attestation when generating a
 * quote.
 *

 * function with the p_pub_key_id set to NULL and the p_pub_key_id_size to a valid size_t pointer.  In this
 * case, the function will return the required buffer size to contain the p_pub_key_id_size and ignore the other

 * the allocated buffer in p_pub_key_id.

 * @param p_qe_target_info Pointer to QE's target info required by the application to generate an enclave REPORT

 *                          NULL.
 * @param p_pub_key_id This parameter can be used in 2 ways. When it is passed in as NULL and p_pub_key_id_size
 *                     is not NULL, the API will return the buffer size required to hold the attestation's
 *                     public key ID.  The other parameters will be ignored.  When it is not NULL, it must point
 *                     to a buffer which is at least a long as the value passed in by p_pub_key_id_size. API will
 *                     return the attestation key's public identifier if no error occured.

 * @return SGX_SUCCESS Successfully selected an attestation key.  Either returns the required attestation's
