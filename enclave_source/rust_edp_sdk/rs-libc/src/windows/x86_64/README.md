How to generate the object files yourself:

Note: The object files in this folder are generated by the following procedure.
      The assembly files were not written with Windows toolchain in mind.
      The following is a way to get around that until that is fixed.

On a linux system, install `binutils-mingw-w64-x86-64`

for Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install binutils-mingw-w64-x86-64
```

for all the `.S` files in the asm folder remove all the lines with .type, .note, .section and .size 

```
cd root/of/rust-sgx/rs-libc/src/asm/x86_64/
# edit all .S files
```

now compile them to create the object files

```
# example
x86_64-w64-mingw32-as fabs.S -o fabs.o
```
