# Building And Debugging Using Visual Studio Code on Windows

This document provides a brief overview of how to build and debug Open Enclave applications using VS Code on Windows.

## Install VS Code

The latest version of Visual Studio Code can be installed from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Install VS Code Extensions

Install the following VS Code extensions. Click on an image to navigate to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace page for the extension.

## Launch Visual Studio Code and Configure

Launch Visual Studio Code from the Windows Start menu.

In the Command Palette, type "CMake: Select a Kit" and select the "Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 - amd64".

Note that this example uses the tools you get when you download and install the [Visual Studio Build Tools 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vs_buildtools.exe) and choose the "C++ build tools" workload. Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 has support for CMake Version 3.15 (CMake ver 3.12 or above is required for building Open Enclave SDK).

![Select a kit](images/VSCodeSelectAKit.png)

Open Workspace Settings by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and typing "Open Workspace Settings" in the command palette.

![Open Workspace Settings](images/VSCodeOpenWorkspaceSettings.png)

Search for the setting "CMake Path" and change the path to point to the CMake executable you would like to use.

In this example we are using the CMake executable that comes when you install Visual Studio build tools 2019 and choose the C++ build tools workload(with the C++ CMake Tools for Windows).

![Specify Path to CMake Generator Executable](images/VSCodeCMakeExe.png)

After this is done, Settings.json created in the .vscode folder would contain the following:

```json
{
    "cmake.cmakePath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\CMake\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe"
}
```

## Configure Your Workspace

Open Workspace Settings by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and typing "Open Workspace Settings" in the command palette.

![Open Workspace Settings](images/VSCodeOpenWorkspaceSettings.png)

Search for the setting "CMake Configure Args" and add an item `-DNUGET_PACKAGE_PATH=path-to-openenclave-nuget-packages`.
Add another item `-DOpenEnclave_DIR=YourOpenEnclaveInstallFolder\lib\openenclave\cmake`

![CMake Configure Args](images/VSCodeCMakeConfigureArgs.png)

For example, if you ran install-windows-prereqs.ps1 with -InstallPath C:\openenclave_prereqs, and you installed the OE SDK nuget package to C:\openenclave, Settings.json would be as below:

```json
{
    "cmake.cmakePath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\CMake\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe",
    "cmake.configureArgs": [
        "-DNUGET_PACKAGE_PATH=C:\\openenclave_prereqs",
        "-DOpenEnclave_DIR=C:\\openenclave\\lib\\openenclave\\cmake"
    ]
}
```

Configure your workspace by typing "cmake configure" in the command palette

![CMake Configure](images/VSCodeCMakeConfigure.png)

Configuration should successfully complete.

## Build And Run Your Open Enclave Application

Build the application by pressing F7 or typing "CMake Build a target" in the command palette, and selecting the "all META" target.

![Build](images/VSCodeBuild.png)

Run your application by pressing Shift+F7 or typing "CMake Build a target" in the command palette, and selecting the "run UTILITY" target.

## Configuring Intellisense

Intellisense should work out of the box for files within your workspace. However, Intellisense may not be aware of where to locate the Open Enclave SDK headers.
Open settings.json under the .vscode folder and add entries for "C_Cpp.default.includePath" and "C_Cpp.default.systemIncludePath".
If you installed the Open Enclave SDK at `C:\openenclave`, the Settings.json would be as below:

```json
{
    "cmake.cmakePath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\CMake\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe",
    "cmake.configureArgs": [
        "-DNUGET_PACKAGE_PATH=C:\\openenclave_prereqs",
        "-DOpenEnclave_DIR=C:\\openenclave\\lib\\openenclave\\cmake"
    ],
    "C_Cpp.default.includePath": ["C:\\openenclave\\include"],
    "C_Cpp.default.systemIncludePath": [
        "C:\\openenclave\\include\\openenclave\\3rdparty\\libc",
        "C:\\openenclave\\include\\openenclave\\3rdparty\\libcxx"
    ]
}
```

## Debug Your Open Enclave Application

Add a CDB Debug Configuration as shown below.

![CDB Debug Configuration](images/VSCodeDebugConfiguration.png)

Fill in program path, parameters and other values in the configuration.

![Edit CDB Debug Configuration](images/VSCodeEditDebugConfiguration.png)

Here is an example of launch.json after editing it.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch",
            "type": "cdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/build/host/helloworld_host.exe",
            "sourcepath": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "workingdirectory": "${workspaceRoot}/build",
            "debugthedebugger": false,
            "initialbreak": false,
            "initialcommands": ".sympath \"\"",
            "args": "enclave/enclave.signed"
        }
    ]
}
```

Open host.c and add a breakpoint. Start debugging.

![Host Breakpoint](images/VSCodeHostBreakpoint.png)

Step over the line that creates the enclave. The Console pane should show that the enclave has been loaded.

![Stop After Enclave Creation](images/VSCodeStopAfterEnclaveCreation.png)

Note: [CDB commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/) can be executed in the Console Prompt.

![Debug Console](images/VSCodeDebugConsole.png)

Open enc.c and put a breakpoint and continue execution.

## Known Issues

The VS Code Debugger extension is currently released as an early preview.
These issues are being worked on and will be fixed in an upcoming update.

- Breakpoints aren't yet completely persisted and restored correctly.
Therefore, it is recommended that you clear all breakpoints and set them again every time the program is launched for debugging.
- The debugging session is not terminated when the program runs to completion.
Therefore, it is recommended that you stop and start a new debugging session each time.
- The debug cursor often jumps to the start of the file while debugging within an enclave.
Stepping again should take the cursor to the correct location.
