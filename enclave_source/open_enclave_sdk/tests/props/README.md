This directory tests the usage of enclave properties, which may be defined
in one of two ways:

- Using the OE_SET_ENCLAVE_SGX macro (for unsigned debug enclaves)
- Using the OESIGN tool (for signed enclaves)

In both cases, the enclave properties are written to a special enclave
properties section (.oeinfo) within the enclave image.

The enclave loader is able to load unsigned debug images, by use of the
OE_SET_ENCLAVE_SGX macro.

The propshost program tests both of these scenarios. It is run once for 
the unsigned case and once for the signed case as follows.

The test also verifies that legacy and AVX configurations work for creating enclaves.

```
# ./host/propshost ./enc/propsenc unsigned
# ./host/propshost ./enc/propsenc.signed signed
```

These tests check that the enclave properties contain the expected values.
