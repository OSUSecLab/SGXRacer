Additional Crypto API tests
===========================

==Preparing Test Data==

All the certificates and certificate revocation lists needed by this test are dynamically generated by the custom commands embedded inside 
crypto_crls_cert_chains/host CMakeLists.txt 
  
==List of Tests==

  1. test_cert_chain_positive
       Asserts the following condition: "In a valid cert chain, each certificate's issuer is also present in the chain".
       Tests various ordering, duplicates, two and three level chains.
  2. test_cert_chain_negative: Negative tests involving missing certs etc.
  3. test_crls.
      1. Assert that verify succeeds when no crls are passed.
      2. Assert that when crls are passed, but don't revoke certs, verify succeeds.
      3. Assert that when crl revoking leaf is passed, verify fails.
      4. Assert that when crl revoking intermediate is passed in, verify fails. (This behavior is currently broken.)
      5. Assert that when only one crl is passed in (either root or intermediate), verify fails. (This behavior is currently broken.)
