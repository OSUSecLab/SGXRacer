pythonExtension
====

This directory contains the sources for the GDB python extension. That 
extension is used to load enclave symbol, enable enclave debugging, and 
stitch stacks etc. 

It will be loaded into gdb as a plugin. Please refer to 
https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Extending-GDB.html for GDB 
python extension model.
