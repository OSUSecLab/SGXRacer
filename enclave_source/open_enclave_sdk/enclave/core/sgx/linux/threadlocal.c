/**
 * There are two ways to create thread-local variables:
 *   1) GNU __thread keyword
 *      This can be applied only to POD types; i.e types that are initialized to
 *      a constant value, and don't have a constructor or destructor.
 *   2) C++11 thread_local keyword
 *      This can be applied to POD types, as well as to types with constructors
 *      and/or destructors.
 *
 * Thread-local variables that are explicitly initialized to constant values are
 * put in .tdata section. Thread-local variables that are not initialized or
 * that have complex initializers and/or destructors are put in .tbss section.
 * E.g:
 *      __thread int v1 = 56;           // Put in .tdata
 *      thread_local int v2 = 77;       // Put in .tdata
 *
 *      __thread int v3;                // Not initialized. Put in .tbss
 *      thread_local string s("Hello"); // Complex initializer. Put in .tbss
 *
 * .tdata section acts as a template for initializing the thread local-storage
 * of each thread since it contains the initial values of the variables.
 *
 * .tbss section just contains total size of the variables in .tbss section.
 *
 * In order to initialize the thread-local storage for a thread, the .tdata
 * section must be copied over to the correct offset from the fs register.
 * Also the space for .tbss section must be allocated and initialized to zeros.
 * The typical layout is as follows:
 *
 *                          +----------------------------+
 *                   FS[0]  | Self pointer (value of FS) |
 *                          +----------------------------+
 *                   FS[-1] |  tbss variables            |
 *                          |  This section is zero      |
 *                          |  initialized. Section size |
 *                          |  is aligned according to   |
 *                          |  alignment specified in elf|
 *  FS[-tbss start offset]  +----------------------------+
 *                          |  tdata variables           |
 *                          |  The contents of .tdata    |
 *                          |  template is copied here.  |
 *                          |  Section size is aligned   |
 *                          |  according to alignment    |
 *                          | specified in elf.          |
 *  FS[-tdata start offset] +----------------------------+   <- tls data start
 *
 * In x86-64, the FS register is used to access thread-local data.
 * Just like GS[0], FS[0] is a self pointer and must contain the value of FS.
 * Note that negative indexing is used with FS. Thus the thread-local variables
 * lie before FS.
 *
 * Both .tdata and .tbss sections have alignment. The alignment must be used to
 * adjust their specified size values.
 * Consider
 *        __thread char chars[6];  // 6 bytes
 *        __thread int g = 45;     // 4 bytes
 * Assume that g is the first variable in the .tdata section and that
 * the .tdata section size is 10 bytes and that the alignment is 4 bytes.
 * Then the aligned size of the section is 12 bytes and the compiler
 * uses the offset %FS:-12 to access g instead of %FS:-10.
 *
 * Note: Both .tdata and .tbss sections can have different alignments.
 * In such cases, the larger of the alignments is used to align both the
 * sections. In x86-64, as observed by doing 'objdump -h' on an elf file, all
 * sections are aligned to a power of two. This implies that the alignment of
 * one section must be a multiple of the alignment of the other.
 *
 * Initializing variables with complex initializers:
 * Consider
 *       thread_local int x = random();
 *       int foo() { return x; }
 *
 * This variable is put in .tbss section.
 * At a high-level, the compiler transforms the access of x to call to
 * a thread-local dynamic initializer of x.
 *       thread_local int x;   // Put in .tbss
 *       thread_local bool x_initialized; // Introduced by compiler to keep
 *                                        // track of x's initialization.
 *       int foo()
 *       {
 *          if (!x_initialized)
 *              dynamic_initializer_for_x();
 *          return x;
 *       }
 * The compiler uses an extra thread-local variable to check if x has been
 * initialized or not. If x has not been initialized, then the initializer
 * for x is called. With optimizations enabled, many if not all, of
 * these function calls get inlined and optimized.
 *
 * Variables with complex destructors:
 * Consider
 *       thread_local my_class x;
 * In the thread-local dynamic initializer for x, immediately after x has been
 * initialized, a call is made to the ABI function __cxa_thread_atexit:
 *       __cxa_thread_atexit(&my_class::~myclass, &x)
 * This allows the runtime system to invoke the destructor on the object when
 * the thread shutsdown.
 *
 * Note:
 * There are different thread-local models (see -ftls-model compiler option)
 * and the compiler normally emits a call to __tls_get_addr function to
 * access thread local variables. Since the enclave is linked as the main
 * executable, the linker performs *guaranteed optimizations* to remove the
 * calls to __tls_get_addr and to reduce thread-local variable access to simple
 * FS register offsets. To handle dynamically loaded modules we need to
 * implement __tls_get_addr.
 * For complete reference see: Elf Handling for Thread-Local Storage.
 *
 * The thread-locals described above follow the "Local-Exec" tls model.
 * They produce the most efficient opcodes for accessing thread-local variables.
 *
 * The thread-locals described below follow the "Initial-Exec" tls model.
 * They are also very efficient, but require and extra memory dereference
 * compared to the "Local-Exec" model.
 *
 * The other two models - "Local-Dynamic" and "Global-Dynamic" are currently
 * not supported since they are more applicable to a multi-module enclaves
 * scenario (i.e many shared libraries loaded into a single enclave.).
 * Using those tls-model, via a combination of compiler and linker flags,
 * would result in a link error since the __tls_get_addr function is not
 * defined.
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 * Exported thread-locals and shared-libraries:
 *
 * When thread-local variables are exported (via visibility=default), then the
 * linker does not optimize the access of a thread-local variable to a constant
 * offset from the FS register. Instead, for each thread-local variable,
 * another variable is introduced varname@tpoff that contains the offset for
 * the thread local variable. The offset value for varname@tpoff is expected to
 * be filled up by the dynamic linker/loader.
 * Consider,
 *         __attribute__((visibility=default)) __thread int x;
 *         int foo() { return x; }
 *
 * This results in the following code to access x
 *     foo:
 *         ...
 *         mov %FS:0, %rax            // Fetch the address of the FS segment
 *         add x@tpoff(%rip), %rax    // Fetch offset for x from the
 *                                    // relocation entry x@tpoff and add it to
 *                                    // FS
 *         mov (%rax), rax            // Fetch value of x
 *
 * Each @tpoff variable results in a relocation entry of the type
 * R_X86_64_TPOFF64. The relocation entry contains enough information to fill
 * the value of the @tpoff variable.
 * R_X86_64_TPOFF64 relocation info contains the following fields:
 *
 *    r_offset = relative address of the corresponding tpoff variable
 *    r_info.relocation_type = R_X86_64_TPOFF64
 *    r_info.symbol = index of symbol in the .dynsym section.
 *    r_addend = 0
 *
 * The value (st_value) of the symbol in the .dynsym section contains the offset
 * to the thread-local variable from the *start* of the thread-local section.
 * Thus:
 *    &x = tls-start + symbol sh_value.
 *
 * Since the compiler emits code relative to the end of the section (i.e using
 * FS), the tpoff is computed via the formula:
 *     tpoff = FS - (tls-start + sh-value).
 *
 * Thus, performing relocations for thread-local variables involves setting the
 * value of the corresponding tpoff variables to the offset from the FS register
 * value.
 *
 * To avoid looking up symbols within the enclave (symbols are not available)
 * the loader fetches the symbol's sh-value and stores it in the r_addend field
 * (r_added field is otherwise zero for R_X86_64_TPOFF64).
