## This function adds a CMake target for the DCAP client and its dependencies provided through nuget
## redistributable packages. This allows the caller to add a dependency on these redistributables so
## that they will be copied to the output folder along with the target taking the dependency.
##
## TARGET_NAME: Name of the target to add for the DCAP client redistributables that the caller will
##              call add_dependency on. This should be unique for each caller.
