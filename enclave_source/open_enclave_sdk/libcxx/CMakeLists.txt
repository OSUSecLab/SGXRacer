# NOTE: The three listed libraries are all `OBJECT` libraries, which
# is just a collection of objects known to CMake. By "linking" them
# here, we're actually combining all the objects into a single static
# library using CMake, which is portable. This also transitively pulls
# in all the public compile options, compile definitions, and include
# directories of these targets and their dependencies (such as
# `oelibc`). Hence this file has more comments than code.
