musl libc:
==========

This directory contains **musl libc**, obtained from this URL.

```
https://www.musl-libc.org/releases/musl-1.1.19.tar.gz
```

Typing **make** installs the source tree under the build directory and
applies patches to it. Nothing is built though, as building is performed
from the **libc** directory.
