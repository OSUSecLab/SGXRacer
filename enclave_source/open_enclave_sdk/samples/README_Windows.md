# Building Open Enclave SDK Samples on Windows

All the samples that come with the Open Enclave SDK installation share a similar directory structure and build instructions. This document describes how to setup, build, sign and run these samples.

## Common Sample information

### How Sample source code directories were structured

Open Enclave SDK helps developers build enclave applications. An enclave application is partitioned into an untrusted component (called a host) and a trusted component (called an enclave).

An enclave is a secure container whose memory (text and data) is protected from access by outside entities, including the host, privileged users, and even the hardware. All functionality that needs to be run in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) should be compiled into the enclave binary. The enclave may run in an untrusted environment with the expectation that secrets will not be compromised. On Windows and Linux, enclaves are ELF binaries.

A host is a normal user mode application that loads an enclave into its address space before starting interacting with an enclave.

All the samples that come with the Open Enclave SDK installation are all structured into two subdirectories (one for enclave and one for host) accordingly.

| Files/dir        |  contents                                   |
|:-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| enclave        | Files needed for building the sample enclave  |
| host           | Files needed for building the host            |

### Prepare samples

Building a sample will write intermediate and output files into the sample directory. If you would like to use a separate working directory for building samples, you can copy the samples to your working directory first. For example, if the SDK was installed to C:\openenclave:

```cmd
xcopy C:\openenclave\share\openenclave\samples C:\mysample
```

### How to build and run samples

1. [x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017 or 2019](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs)

2. Set `OpenEnclave_DIR` to the cmake directory in the Open Enclave SDK installation.

As an example, if the Open Enclave SDK is installed to `C:\openenclave`, then you would set `OpenEnclave_DIR` as shown below

```cmd
set OpenEnclave_DIR=C:\openenclave\lib\openenclave\cmake
```

3. To build a sample using CMake, change directory to your target sample directory and execute the following commands:

```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja -DNUGET_PACKAGE_PATH=C:\oe_prereqs
ninja
```

4. To run the sample, use below:

```cmd
ninja run
```
