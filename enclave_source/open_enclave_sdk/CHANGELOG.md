[v0.7.0-rc1] - 2019-10-08
-------------------------

### Added

- Support Intel DCAP attestation on Windows.
- Support `transition_using_threads` EDL attribute in oeedger8r.
    - This only applies to untrusted functions (ocalls) in this release.
    - Using this attribute allows the ocall to be invoked without incurring the
      performance cost of an enclave context switch.
- Ability to debug ELF enclaves on Windows using Windbg/CDB
    - [Visual Studio Code CDB Extension](https://aka.ms/CDBVSCode)
    - [WinDbg Preview](https://aka.ms/WinDbgPreview)
    - The new oedebugrt.dll binary needs to be copied to the app folder to enable this.
- Preview support for 64-bit ARM TrustZone-capable boards with OP-TEE OS
  - See the [documentation](docs/GettingStartedDocs/OP-TEE/Introduction.md)
    for the list of supported platforms, features, and known issues.

### Changed

- Transferred repository from [microsoft/openenclave](https://github.com/microsoft/openenclave)
  to [openenclave/openenclave](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave).
- Change debugging contract for oegdb. Enclaves and hosts built prior to this
  release cannot be debugged with this version of oegdb and vice versa.
- Update Intel DCAP library dependencies to 1.3.
- Update Intel PSW dependencies to 2.7 on Linux and 2.5 on Windows.
- SGX1 configurations always take build dependency on Intel SGX enclave common library.
- Update LLVM libcxx to version 8.0.0.
- Update mbedTLS to version 2.16.2.

### Deprecated

- The mbedTLS libraries used in Open Enclave will no longer be compiled with the
  following config.h options in the next (v0.8) release:
    - `MBEDTLS_TLS_DEFAULT_ALLOW_SHA1_IN_KEY_EXCHANGE`: Considerable advances
      have been made in breaking SHA1 since our original review and we would
      like to be more prescriptive in recommending the use of SHA256.
    - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_RSA_ENABLED`: This option provides no perfect
      forward secrecy and is generally becoming less popular as this is
      recognized. The ECDHE variants are also more performant.

### Security

- Fix enclave heap memory disclosure (CVE-2019-1369).

[v0.6.0] - 2019-06-29
---------------------

### Changed

- Rename `oe-gdb` to `oegdb` for consistency with other tools, such as `oesign`.
- Update pkg-config and CMake exports to include the following hardening build
  flags by default:
    - Enclaves will:
       - Compile with `-fPIE` instead of `-fPIC`.
       - Link with `-Wl,-z,noexecstack`, `-Wl,-z,now`.
    - Host apps will:
       - Compile with `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` (only effective if compiling under
         GCC with `-O2` specified) and `-fstack-protector-strong`.
       - Link with `-Wl,-z,noexecstack`.
       - Note that `-Wl,-z,now` is _not_ enabled by default, but app authors
         should enable it themselves after assessing its startup impact.
- Removed support for the previously deprecated `OE_API_VERSION=1` APIs.
- Update MUSL libc to version 1.1.21.
- Update mbedTLS to version 2.7.11.

[v0.5.0] - 2019-04-09
---------------------

### Added

- Open Enclave SDK works in Windows
   - Build using Visual Studio 2017's CMake Support
   - Build in x64 Native Prompt using Ninja
- Function table/id based ecall/ocall dispatching
   - oeedger8r generates ecall tables and ocall tables
   - Dispatching based on function-id (index into table)
   - oeedger8r generates `oe_create_foo_enclave` function for `foo.edl`
   - oe-gdb allows attaching to a host that is already running
- oe-gdb allows attaching to a host that is already running
- Added Quote Enclave Identity validation into `oe_verify_report` implementation
- Added OE SDK internal logging mechanism
- Support for thread local variables
   - Both GNU `__thread` and C++11 `thread_local`
   - Both hardware and simulation mode
   - Enclaves are compiled using local-exec thread-local model (-ftls-model=local-exec)
- Added `oe_get_public_key` and `oe_get_public_key_by_policy` host functions,
  which allow the host to get a public key derived from an enclave's identity.
- Added v2 versions of the following APIs that instead of passing in buffers now
  return a buffer that needs to be freed via an associated free method. `OE_API_VERSION`
  needs to be set to 2 to pick up the versions. The mentioned APIs have a *_V1 and *_V2
  version that the below versions map to detending on the `OE_API_VERSION`.
   - `oe_get_report`, free `report_buffer` via `oe_free_report`
   - `oe_get_target_info`, free `target_info_buffer` via `oe_free_target_info`
   - `oe_get_seal_key`, free `key_buffer` and `key_info` via `oe_free_seal_key`
   - `oe_get_seal_key_by_policy`, free `key_buffer` and `key_info` via `oe_free_seal_key`
- Added new enumeration for enclave type parameter of `oe_create_enclave`. Now use
  `OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_AUTO` to have the enclave appropriate to your built environment
  be chosen automatically. For instance, building Intel binaries will select SGX
  automatically, where on ARM it will pick TrustZone.
- Added three new APIs for attestation certificate generation and verification

### Changed

- `oe_create_enclave` takes two additional parameters: `ocall_table` and
  `ocall_table_size`.
- Update mbedTLS library to version 2.7.9.
- Update MUSL libc to version 1.1.20.
- Update LLVM libcxx to version 7.0.0.
   - Some libcxx headers (e.g. `<string>`) now use C++11 template features and
     may require compiling with the `-std=c++11` option when building with GCC.
- Update minimum required CMake version for building from source to 3.13.1.
- Update minimum required C++ standard for building from source to C++14.
- Moved `oe_seal_policy_t`, `oe_asymmetric_key_type_t`, `oe_asymmetric_key_format_t`,
  and `oe_asymmetric_key_params_t` to `bits/types.h` from `enclave.h`.
- Changed minimum required QE ISVSVN version from 1 to 2 for the QE Identity
  revocation check that is performed during quote verification. Remote reports
  that were generated with a QE ISVSVN version of 1 will fail during report
  verification now. To resolve this issue, please install the latest version
  of the [Intel SGX DCAP packages](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads)
  (1.0.1 or newer) on the system that generates the remote report.
- Revamped `oesign` CLI tool arguments parsing. Instead of relying on the arguments
  order and name, named parameters are used as such:
   - The `sign` subcommand accepts the following mandatory flags:
     - `--enclave-image [-e]`, the enclave image file path
     - `--config-file [-c]`, the path of the config file with enclave properties
     - `--key-file [-k]`, the path of the private key file used to digitally sign the enclave image
   - The `dump` subcommand accepts only the `--enclave-image [-e]` mandatory flag, for the enclave file path.

### Deprecated

- String based `ocalls`/`ecalls`, `OE_ECALL`, and `OE_OCALL` macros.
- `OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_UNDEFINED` was removed and replaced with `OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_AUTO`.

### Fixed

- Check support for AVX in platform/OS before setting SECS.ATTRIBUTES.XFRM in enclave.

### Security

- Fix CVE-2019-0876
   - `_handle_sgx_get_report` will now write to the supplied argument if it lies in host memory.
   - Added check for missing null terminator in oeedger8r generated code.

[v0.4.1] - 2018-12-21 (DEPRECATED)
----------------------------------

v0.4.1 contains a small fix to work with Intel's new ISV version bump.

### Changed

- This allows the OE SDK to continue to support reports signed by QE SVN=1,
  and at the same time also allow a newer QE SVN (greater than 1) during the
  oe_verify_report process.

[v0.4.0] - 2018-10-08 (DEPRECATED)
----------------------------------

v0.4.0 is the first public preview release, with numerous breaking changes from v0.1.0

- Support full SGX DCAP remote report (quote) revocation.
- Expand documentation for running on different configurations.
- Add pkg-config files for building Open Enclave apps in C/C++ for GCC or Clang.
- Add data sealing sample.
- Add `oe_call_host_by_address()` to allow enclaves to make OCALLs by callback pointer.
- Add `oe_get_enclave()` to obtain enclave handle to return to host.
- Add `oe_get_target_info()` to support SGX local attestation.
- Add CMake export configuration to SDK (experimental).

- Change `oe_identity.authorID` field to `oe_identity.signerID`.
- Clean up thread local storage on return from ECALL.
- Refactor liboecore and liboeenclave dependency.
   - All enclave apps must now link liboeenclave.
- Refactor liboecore and liboelibc dependency.
   - All enclave apps should call libc for C functions instead.
- Break up remote attestation sample into 4 separate samples.
- Simplify `oe_get_report()` so it doesn't accept unused `reportdata` on host side.
- Reduce the set of `oe_result` values returned.
- Update mbedTLS library to version 2.7.5.
