//! # Cryptography Library Helper
//!
//! This crate provides helper functions to simplify key distribution and
//! encryption/decryption. It utilizes sgx_tcrypto and sgx_ucrypto to provide
//! a uniform interface to both enclave and untrusted app. It provides key
//! serialization/deserialization by serde.
//!
//! The Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK includes a trusted cryptography
//! library named sgx_tcrypto. It includes the cryptographic functions used by
//! other trusted libraries included in the SDK.
//!
