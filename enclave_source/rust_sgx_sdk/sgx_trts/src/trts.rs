/// rsgx_read_rand function is used to generate a random number inside the enclave.
///
/// # Description
///
/// The rsgx_read_rand function is provided to replace the standard pseudo-random sequence generation functions
/// inside the enclave, since these standard functions are not supported in the enclave, such as rand, srand, etc.
/// For HW mode, the function generates a real-random sequence; while in simulation mode, the function generates
/// a pseudo-random sequence.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// **rand**
///
/// A pointer to the buffer that stores the generated random number. The rand buffer can be either within or outside the enclave,
/// but it is not allowed to be across the enclave boundary or wrapped around.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// Library: libsgx_trts.a
///
/// # Errors
///
/// **SGX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER**
///
/// Invalid input parameters detected.
///
/// **SGX_ERROR_UNEXPECTED**
///
/// Indicates an unexpected error occurs during the valid random number generation process.
///
