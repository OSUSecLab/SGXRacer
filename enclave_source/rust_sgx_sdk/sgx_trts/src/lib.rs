//! # Trusted Runtime System
//!
//! The Intel(R) SGX trusted runtime system (tRTS) is a key component of the Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK.
//! It provides the enclave entry point logic as well as other functions to be used by enclave developers.
//!
//! **Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Helper Functions**
//!
//! **CustomExceptionHandling**
//!
//! # Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Helper Functions
//!
//! The tRTS provides the helper functions for you to determine whether a given address is within or outside
//! enclave memory.
//!
//! The tRTS provides a wrapper to the RDRAND instruction to generate a true random number from hardware.
//! enclave developers should use the rsgx_read_rand function to get true random numbers.
//!
//! # CustomExceptionHandling
//!
//! The Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK provides an API to allow you to register functions, or exception handlers,
//! to handle a limited set of hardware exceptions. When one of the enclave supported hardware exceptions occurs within
//! the enclave, the registered exception handlers will be called in a specific order until an exception handler reports
//! that it has handled the exception. For example, issuing a CPUID instruction inside an Enclave will result in a #UD fault
//! (Invalid Opcode Exception). ISV enclave code can call rsgx_register_exception_handler to register a function of type
//! sgx_exception_handler_t to respond to this exception. To check a list of enclave supported exceptions, see Intel(R)
//! Software Guard Extensions Programming Reference.
//!
//! **Note**
//!
//! Custom exception handling is only supported in HW mode. Although the exception handlers can be registered in simulation mode,
//! the exceptions cannot be caught and handled within the enclave.
//!
//! **Note**
//!
//! OCALLs are not allowed in the exception handler.
//!
//! **Note**
//!
//! Custom exception handing only saves general purpose registers in sgx_ exception_info_t. You should be careful when touching
//! other registers in the exception handlers.
//!
//! **Note**
//!
//! If the exception handlers can not handle the exceptions, abort() is called.
//! abort() makes the enclave unusable and generates another exception.
