/// The rsgx_cpuid function performs the equivalent of a cpuid() function call or
/// intrinisic which executes the CPUID instruction to query the host processor for
/// the information about supported features.
///
/// **Note**
///
/// This function performs an OCALL to execute the CPUID instruction.
///
/// # Description
///
/// This function provides the equivalent of the cpuid() function or intrinsic. The
/// function executes the CPUID instruction for the given leaf (input). The CPUID
/// instruction provides processor feature and type information that is returned in
/// cpuinfo, an array of 4 integers to specify the values of EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX
/// registers. rsgx_cpuid performs an OCALL by invoking oc_cpuidex to get the
/// info from untrusted side because the CPUID instruction is an illegal instruction
/// in the enclave domain.
///
/// **Note**
///
/// As the CPUID instruction is executed by an OCALL, the results should not
/// be trusted. Code should verify the results and perform a threat evaluation
/// to determine the impact on trusted code if the results were
/// spoofed.
///
/// The implementation of this function performs an OCALL and therefore,
/// this function will not have the same serializing or fencing behavior of
/// executing a CPUID instruction in an untrusted domain code flow.
///
/// # Parameters

/// **leaf**
