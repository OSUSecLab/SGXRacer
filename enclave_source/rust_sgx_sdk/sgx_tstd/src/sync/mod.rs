//! The Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK already supports mutex and conditional
//! variable synchronization mechanisms by means of the following APIand data types
//! defined in the Types and Enumerations section. Some functions included in the
//! trusted Thread Synchronization library may make calls outside the enclave (OCALLs).
//! If you use any of the APIs below, you must first import the needed OCALL functions
//! from sgx_tstdc.edl. Otherwise, you will get a linker error when the enclave is
//! being built; see Calling Functions outside the Enclave for additional details.
//! The table below illustrates the primitives that the Intel(R) SGX Thread
//! Synchronization library supports, as well as the OCALLs that each API function needs.
