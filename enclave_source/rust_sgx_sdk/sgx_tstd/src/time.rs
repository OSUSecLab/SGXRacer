/// A measurement of a monotonically nondecreasing clock.
/// Opaque and useful only with `Duration`.
///
/// Instants are always guaranteed to be no less than any previously measured
/// instant when created, and are often useful for tasks such as measuring
/// benchmarks or timing how long an operation takes.
///
/// Note, however, that instants are not guaranteed to be **steady**.  In other
/// words, each tick of the underlying clock may not be the same length (e.g.
/// some seconds may be longer than others). An instant may jump forwards or
/// experience time dilation (slow down or speed up), but it will never go
/// backwards.
///
/// Instants are opaque types that can only be compared to one another. There is
/// no method to get "the number of seconds" from an instant. Instead, it only
/// allows measuring the duration between two instants (or comparing two
/// instants).
///
/// The size of an `Instant` struct may vary depending on the target operating
/// system.

///
/// Distinct from the [`Instant`] type, this time measurement **is not

/// save another file to the file system, **and the second file has a
/// `SystemTime` measurement earlier than the first**. In other words, an
/// operation that happens after another operation in real time may have an
/// earlier `SystemTime`!
///
/// Consequently, comparing two `SystemTime` instances to learn about the
/// duration between them returns a [`Result`] instead of an infallible [`Duration`]
/// to indicate that this sort of time drift may happen and needs to be handled.
///
/// Although a `SystemTime` cannot be directly inspected, the [`UNIX_EPOCH`]
/// constant is provided in this module as an anchor in time to learn
