//! Standard library macros
//!
//! This modules contains a set of macros which are exported from the standard
//! library. Each macro is available for use when linking against the standard
//! library.

/// The entry point for panic of Rust threads.
///
/// This macro is used to inject panic into a Rust thread, causing the thread to
/// panic entirely. Each thread's panic can be reaped as the `Box<Any>` type,
/// and the single-argument form of the `panic!` macro will be the value which
/// is transmitted.
///
/// The multi-argument form of this macro panics with a string and has the
/// `format!` syntax for building a string.
///
/// # Current implementation
///
/// If the main thread panics it will terminate all your threads and end your
/// program with code `101`.
